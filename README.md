#### Idea originated from Assist. Hojae Han @ [Data Intelligence Lab](http://dilab.yonsei.ac.kr/) (Currently moved to SNU)
#### Advisor [Seungwon Hwang](https://seungwonh.github.io/) @ [Data Intelligence Lab](http://dilab.yonsei.ac.kr/) (Currently moved to SNU)


#### Question Answering task is vulnerable to Adversarial Attack and QA model has a possibility to learn unnecessary dependency between Question and Answer. To solve this problem, we propose a new approach to imporve Question Answering model using Question Generation.
